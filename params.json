{"name":"Low Power Teensy 3.0/3.1","tagline":"Library for putting the teensy 3.0/3.1 into low power modes","body":"# LowPower_Teensy3 Library\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Teensyduino 1.14 or greater then there is one edit you need to make\r\nto the mk20dx128.c core file: Add -> \"PMC_REGSC |= 0x08;\" just under \"SCB_VTOR = 0;\" just\r\nunder the ResetHandler function. This allows the mcu to release hold of the I/O when\r\nwaking from sleep.\r\n***\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog Beta2:\r\n> 1.    Added struct to store sleep configurations\r\n> 2.    Added RTC Alarm wake\r\n> 3.    Added TSI wake\r\n> 4.    Put usb regulator in standby for VLPR\r\n> 5.    Got rid of stand alone LPTMR timer fucntions\r\n> 6.    Cleaned up the library and example codes\r\n> 7.    New examples added\r\n> 8.    Defined GPIO wake pin names\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog Stable v1.0:\r\n> 1.    Fixed where VLPR was not being retained becase of LPWUI bit not being set right\r\n> 2.    Added feature to enable LPWUI bit to exit VLPR with any interrupt\r\n> 3.    Fixed issue with VLPR locking up system if being called before exiting VLPR\r\n> 4.    Disabled USB Regulator Standby mode during Low Power\r\n> 5.    Cleaned up library code.\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog beta v1.1:\r\n> 1.    Added all digital wakeup capable pins for DeepSleep and Hibernate function\r\n> 2.    User can now use callback function for DeepSleep and Hibernate\r\n> 3.    Added Sleep function, now any interrupt can wake the processor\r\n> 4.    Improved code performance\r\n> 5.    New example for Sleep function\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog beta v1.2:\r\n> 1.    Using Bitband to set peripheral clocks\r\n> 2.    Added support for ```IntervalTimer, delay, delayMicroseconds``` for dynamic CPU scaling\r\n> 3.    Added support for HardwareSerial for 16,8,4,2 MHz","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
